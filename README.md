# Firebase-Train-App

Employs Firebase and Moment.js to create a persistent scheduling based app. The user can enter the name of their train, the time of it's first arrival, and it's destination. The app will then append the user's input to the existing table and calculate the time of the train's next arrival along with the minutes until the actual arrival.
